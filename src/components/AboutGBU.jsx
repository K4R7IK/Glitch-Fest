              Situated in the tech-bowl of India, Greater Noida, Gautam Buddha
              University is a leading institution that offers graduate and
              post-graduate degrees in diverse fields of education. GBU polishes
              the imperfections within its students and helps them sparkle like
              diamonds.
              <br />
              Gautam Buddha University boasts a robust infrastructure and has a
              grand campus, which is probably one of the most picturesque and
              breathtaking in the entire country, if not the most. Itâ€™s not a
              wonder why the university has become a favoured venue for
              conducting key events, both of national and international
              importance.

              But bhai seriously yeh university students to support nahi karti jayda. Bus teachers apne pocket fill karne mein lage h. Student ki maa ki ch*t.
