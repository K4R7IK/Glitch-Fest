              Hackfed was started with just one aim in mind - to
              gather fresh, young minds and direct them to a
              path that leads to a brighter future. We are a
              thriving student community, with over 2k members
              currently associated with us.
              The Hackfed community is a sanctuary for like-
              minded individuals where they can learn and master
              new skills. Our communityâ€™s foundation rests upon
              the strengths of collaboration and support.
              What inspires us is our firm belief that one should
              always look for fresh prospects to expand their
              knowledge, and guide others along the way too.
