          Situated in the tech-bowl of India, Greater Noida, Gautam Buddha
          University is a leading institution that offers graduate and
          post-graduate degrees in diverse fields of education. GBU polishes the
          imperfections within its students and helps them sparkle like
          diamonds.
          <br />
          Gautam Buddha University boasts a robust infrastructure and has a
          grand campus, which is probably one of the most picturesque and
          breathtaking in the entire country, if not the most. Itâ€™s not a wonder
          why the university has become a favoured venue for conducting key
          events, both of national and international importance.
